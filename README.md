# 2048-Puzzle-Solver-Reinforcement-Learning
This project leverages Q-learning and TensorFlow to train an AI agent for the 2048 puzzle. Developed and analyzed in Jupyter Notebook, the agent learns optimal strategies through trial-and-error, improving its performance with each interaction. This work highlights the potential of RL for solving complex decision-making and optimization problems.
