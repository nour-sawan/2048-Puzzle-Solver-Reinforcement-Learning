# 2048-Puzzle-Solver-Reinforcement-Learning
This project uses Q-learning and TensorFlow to train an intelligent agent for the 2048 puzzle. By interacting with the game, the agent learns optimal strategies through trial-and-error, refining its actions to maximize scores. It demonstrates the potential of Reinforcement Learning for solving complex decision-making and optimization challenges.
